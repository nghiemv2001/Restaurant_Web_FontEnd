        <p>Rustic Elegance Park is a fine dining restaurant located in the serene countryside. The restaurant offers a picturesque view of the surrounding rolling hills and sits in a charming vintage farmhouse on the corner of Oakwood Lane and Country Road. Established in 2005, it underwent a complete renovation and redesign in the spring of 2020.</p>
        <p>The restaurant has been owned by Chef Sarah Thompson since 2015 and has evolved significantly in both its cuisine and overall experience. Our tasting, five-course, and bar menus feature a delightful blend of locally-sourced ingredients. Guests can also visit the bar for light snacks, or simply enjoy a cocktail or a glass of wine.</p>
